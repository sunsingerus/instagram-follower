Instagram Follower - special for Anna Wasal

# Introduction

Described URL `http://instagram.com/ploterline/followers/` endpoint isn't really easy-to-use RESTful endpoint. 
Instagram fetches information with AJAXs after user click the `Followers` button.
Quick research did not allow me to find a way to get that information without using Selenium, which can load and render 
the javascript that displays the followers to the user. So, we have a Selenium-based solution which mocks human behavior, including random pauses between actions (Which ca be configurable, of course).
For such a solution Google Chrome Browser is required

## Requirements

  * Google Chrome
  * Google Chrome Driver
  * Python 3.5

## Installation

Google Chrome browser is required
```bash
echo "deb [arch=amd64] http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb/ stable main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/chrome.list
wget -q -O - https://dl-ssl.google.com/linux/linux_signing_key.pub | apt-key add -
apt-get update
apt-get install google-chrome-stable
```

Google Driver is required. It can be dowloaded from
```bash
https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads
```
or from
```bash
https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=2.34/
```
Unzip downloaded file before usage. However, Llinux 64-bit version is already included into this repo, so you may not need to download your driver.

Clone Instagram-follower
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sunsingerus/instagram-follower
```

## Usage

Basic usage
```bash
python3 main.py --username=INSTAGRAM_USER --password=INSTAGRAM_PASSWORD --account=emilia_clarke
```
